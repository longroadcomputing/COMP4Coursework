#User Manual
There are **10 marks** available for this section.

In this section you must produce documentation that will enable the user to operate your system.

To do this you will need to include:

- An introduction that specifies the purpose of the system and who the intended audience are
- Instructions to install and start the application
- A tutorial that describes all of the functions of the application, including:
    - Leading the user through the application and explain the menu options, dialogue boxes and printed reports
    - Explain possible error messages from the system and from your own error-trapping routines and what to do about them
    - Explain how to save data
- Describe any limitations, input validation and things the system will not do
- Say when and how to use back-up and recovery procedures

##Introduction
In the introduction clearly state the **purpose of the system** and who are the **intended audience** for the system. Be sure to give an overview of the functionality and not just an idea of what type of system it is.

##Installation
You system has been most likely designed for a particular platform therefore you must make clear any assumptions you are making about the existing hardware and software configuration required to install your system.

In most cases you will need to identify:

- The hardware configuration required  (refer to your design where you specified this)
- The operating system version
- Any required applications:
    - Please see below for details on your particular environment
- How to install the required applications (if necessary)

###Required Applications
Your system requires **at least** the following applications to be installed (there may be more for your particular implementation):

- PyQt Python Projects:
    - Qt
    - SIP
    - PyQt
    - Python 3
- Python Server-side Projects:
    - Apache Web Server
    - MySQL
    - MySQL.connector
    - Python 3

###Evidence
You should give clear **step-by-step** instructions with **annotated screenshots** explaining how to install and then launch your system on the configuration given in the prerequisites.

##Tutorial
You must demonstrate how to operate each function of your system. If you are making assumptions about the abilities of the user then you should state these clearly before starting the tutorial.

Generally, it is better to make no assumptions about prior knowledge but this will depend on your user.

Arrange the tutorial by **task**, imagine the user were asking you questions that you are going to answer - like a **FAQ - Frequently Asked Questions**. For example:

- How do you add a new order?
- How can I see a report of all the student grades?

When evidencing each question you **must** use **annotated screenshots**. It is important that the user can visualise what you are describing. Be sure to describe the process of completing a given task **step-by-step** - don’t be tempted to miss any stages out.

##Saving
Explain clearly how data is saved in your system. In most cases it happens automatically when a database query is executed.

##Limitations.
Is there anything that the system doesn’t do that might be expected of it? Be sure to explain briefly why this is the case.

##Errors.
There will be several places in your system where errors can result from user actions. These may be down to:

- User error
- Program bugs
- Incomplete sections of code

You must explain **step-by-step** with **annotated screenshots** how to reproduce each error and also how to recover from these errors.

##Back-up/Recovery.
Provide a tutorial that explains how to back-up any data that the system stores and also how to restore the system from a provided back-up.

Again, make sure you explain clearly and provide **step-by-step** instructions with **annotated** screenshots.

##Mark Scheme
The user manual is assessed based on two criteria:

    - the **complexity** of your project
    - the **quality** of your written communication.

You can only score in a particular mark band if your project is appropriately complex for that mark band and you meet the quality of communication criteria for the same mark band.

If you meet the complexity criteria but not the quality of communication criteria then your mark will drop by one mark band.
