#Tracking changes with Git
Git provides a mechanism for you to **commit** your changes every so often. Committing often has two main benefits:

1. You can step back to a earlier version of your code if you make a mistake.
2. You have a log of what work you have done and when you completed that section of work.

##Commit Log
The list of commits that can be retrieved from a repository is useful to you as it can help you **prove** when you did something. This is because a **timestamp** is stored with each commit that you make.

This means that if you commit frequently enough it is possible to show that you have been diligently working on each piece of coursework over a period of time.

If you ever need to prove that work was completed prior to a deadline or that an emergency situation requires an extension having a good commit log will provide the evidence your teacher needs to make an informed decision about whether work should be marked or whether an extension is appropriate.
